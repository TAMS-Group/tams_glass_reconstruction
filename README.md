# Detection and Reconstruction of Transparent Objects with Infrared Projection-based RGB-D Cameras

Robotic manipulation systems frequently utilize RGB-D cam-
eras based on infrared projection to perceive three-dimensional environ
ments. Unfortunately, this technique often fails on transparent objects
such as glasses, bottles and plastic containers. We present methods to
exploit the perceived infrared camera images to detect and reconstruct
volumetric shapes of arbitrary transparent objects. Our reconstruction
pipeline first segments transparent surfaces based on pattern scattering
and absorption, followed by optimization-based multi-view reconstruc
tion of volumetric object models. Outputs from the segmentation stage
can also be utilized for single-view transparent object detection. The
presented methods improve on previous work by analyzing infrared camera images directly and by successfully reconstructing cavities in objects
such as drinking glasses. A dataset of recorded transparent objects, autonomously gathered by a robotic camera-in-hand setup, is published
together with this work.

This repository contains code for generating volumetric 3D reconstructions of transparent objects. For detecting transparent objects, see: https://github.com/TAMS-Group/tams_bartender_glass_recognition.
